# Sizing of cluster:
# A storm cluster consists of 1 nimbus node and n supervisor nodes.
#
# Nimbus node's role is to distribute jobs to supervisors.
#
# Supervisor nodes start and supervise the worker processes in which 
# bolts and spouts are executed.

# Select a linode plan for the nimbus node.
# Nimbus node runs nimbus daemon and UI daemon.
# Plan are from https://www.linode.com/pricing : "2GB | 4GB | 8GB ...."
NIMBUS_NODE="2GB"

# Select count and linode plans for supervisor nodes.
# Supervisor nodes are the workhorses. They host supervisor daemon,
# logviewer daemon, and the worker processes that execute bolts and spouts.
#
# Syntax is: "<plan>:<count> <plan>:<count> ...."
# where <plan> is a plan from https://www.linode.com/pricing : "2GB | 4GB | 8GB ...."
# and count is a numeric count.
# Example: Create 3 supervisor nodes - a 2 GB, a 4 GB and a 8 GB
# SUPERVISOR_NODES="2GB:1 4GB:1 8GB:1"
SUPERVISOR_NODES="2GB:2"

# Select plan for client node.
# Client node is where developers can submit topologies to the cluster.
# Client node also runs the storm UI daemon, which hosts the storm web UI for 
# monitoring the cluster.
#
# Syntax is: "<plan>"
#  where <plan> is a plan from https://www.linode.com/pricing : "2GB | 4GB | 8GB ...."

# ** REQUIRED **
#
# The image conf file to use as a template for creating nodes of this cluster.
# Every node's disk will be a replica of this image.
# Path should be relative to this cluster directory, or an absolute path.
# Examples:
# STORM_IMAGE_CONF=../storm-image1
# STORM_IMAGE_CONF=../storm-image1/storm-image1.conf
# STORM_IMAGE_CONF=/home/clustermgr/storm-linode/storm-image1

# ** REQUIRED **
#
# The zookeeper conf file path *should* include a directory (even if it's just ./), because it gets included as a source file
# in the script.
# Path should be relative to this cluster directory, or an absolute path.
# Examples:
# ZOOKEEPER_CLUSTER=../zk-cluster1
# ZOOKEEPER_CLUSTER=../zk-cluster1/zk-cluster1.conf
# ZOOKEEPER_CLUSTER=/home/clustermgr/storm-linode/zk-cluster1

# A root password for all nodes of this cluster. 
# If none is specified, the image's root password is retained.
# If specified, it should contain at least two of these four character classes: 
# lower case letters - upper case letters - numbers - punctuation.
#
# Some special characters may require escape prefixing and the password to be enclosed in
# single or double quotes.
# Some examples:
# - for password with spaces, enclose in double quotes 
#		NODE_ROOT_PASSWORD="a PassworD with spaces"
#
# - for password with double quotes, enclose in double quotes and prefix every double quote in the password with a backslash \ : 
#		NODE_ROOT_PASSWORD="pswd_WITH_\"dbl\"_quotes"
#
# - for password with $, enclose in double quotes and prefix every $ in the password with a backslash \ :
