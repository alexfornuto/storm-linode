# A unique name for the cluster. Since this is used as a prefix for cluster management files,
# it should be unique.
# Rules:
# - Cannot be empty
# - Maximum 25 characters in length (this constraint is mainly 
#		due to its use as a prefix for iptables ipset names, which can't be >31 characters)
# - Alphabets, digits, hyphens, underscores only
# - No spaces
# - No other special characters

# The datacenter where this cluster should be created.
# This can be any datacenter, but cluster creation may be faster 
# if it's created in the same datacenter as the image.
# Time taken for transferring files from local system is another factor.

# Sizing of cluster:
# A storm cluster consists of 1 nimbus node and n supervisor nodes.
#
# Nimbus node's role is to distribute jobs to supervisors.
#
# Supervisor nodes start and supervise the worker processes in which 
# bolts and spouts are executed.

# Select a linode plan for the nimbus node.
# Nimbus node runs nimbus daemon and UI daemon.
# Plan are from https://www.linode.com/pricing : "1GB | 2GB | 4GB ...."
NIMBUS_NODE="1GB"

# Select count and linode plans for supervisor nodes.
# Supervisor nodes are the workhorses. They host supervisor daemon,
# logviewer daemon, and the worker processes that execute bolts and spouts.
#
# Syntax is: "<plan>:<count> <plan>:<count> ...."
# where <plan> is a plan from https://www.linode.com/pricing : "1GB | 2GB | 4GB ...."
# and count is a numeric count.
# Example: Create 3 supervisor nodes - a 1 GB, a 2 GB and a 4 GB
# SUPERVISOR_NODES="1GB:1 2GB:1 4GB:1"
SUPERVISOR_NODES="1GB:2"

# Select plan for client node.
# Client node is where developers can submit topologies to the cluster.
# Client node also runs the storm UI daemon, which hosts the storm web UI for 
# monitoring the cluster.
#
# Syntax is: "<plan>"
#  where <plan> is a plan from https://www.linode.com/pricing : "1GB | 2GB | 4GB ...."
CLIENT_NODE="1GB"
