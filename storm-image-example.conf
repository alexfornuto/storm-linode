# This a configuration to create a Storm linode disk image which can
# then be replicated for each node during cluster creation.

# Specify an OS distribution ID or distribution label. All nodes of a cluster
# created based on this image will have this distribution.
#
# Note: Currently, only Ubuntu 14 and Debian 8 distributions are supported by these scripts.
# They will likely not work with other distributions.
#
# List all distribution IDs and labels with:
#	"./storm-cluster-linode.sh distributions api_env_production.conf"
#
# List only those distributions containing some string like 'ubuntu' with:
#	"./storm-cluster-linode.sh distributions api_env_production.conf ubuntu"
# Specify either the distribution ID or the distribution label (case does not matter)
# For Ubuntu 14.04 LTS:
# DISTRIBUTION_FOR_IMAGE=124
# or alternatively 
# DISTRIBUTION_FOR_IMAGE="Ubuntu 14.04 LTS"
#
# For Debian 8:
# DISTRIBUTION_FOR_IMAGE=140
# or
# DISTRIBUTION_FOR_IMAGE="Debian 8"
DISTRIBUTION_FOR_IMAGE=124

# A label for the image, as displayed in "images.list".
LABEL_FOR_IMAGE="Storm 0.9.5 Ubuntu 14.04 LTS"

# Default kernel for image: 138 seems to be the constant kernel ID of whatever's the latest 64-bit kernel.
# This kernel is used for all nodes of a cluster created from this image.
KERNEL_FOR_IMAGE=138
# or alternatively the partial or full kernel label (case does not matter)
# KERNEL_FOR_IMAGE="Latest 64 bit" or KERNEL_FOR_IMAGE="3.18.5-x86_64"

# Specify the preferred datacenter disk image is created.
# This can be any datacenter, but cluster creation may be faster 
# if the image is created in the same datacenter where cluster will be
# created.
# Time taken for transferring files from local system is another factor.
DATACENTER_FOR_IMAGE="newark"
# or alternatively, specify the LOCATION or ABBR returned by avail.datacenters (case does not matter)
# DATACENTER_FOR_IMAGE="Newark, NJ, USA"
# DATACENTER_FOR_IMAGE="newark"

# **** REQUIRED *****
#
# Default root password for all nodes in cluster created from this image.
# It can be overridden in each cluster's config file.
# It should contain at least two of these four character classes: 
# lower case letters - upper case letters - numbers - punctuation.
#
# Some special characters may require escape prefixing and the password to be enclosed in
# single or double quotes.
# Some examples:
# - for password with spaces, enclose in double quotes 
#		IMAGE_ROOT_PASSWORD="a PassworD with spaces"
#
# - for password with double quotes, enclose in double quotes and prefix every double quote in the password with a backslash \ : 
#		IMAGE_ROOT_PASSWORD="pswd_WITH_\"dbl\"_quotes"
#
# - for password with $, enclose in double quotes and prefix every $ in the password with a backslash \ : 
#		IMAGE_ROOT_PASSWORD="pswd_with_\$a_"
IMAGE_ROOT_PASSWORD=""

# **** REQUIRED *****
#
# Default root SSH public and private key file. All nodes in a cluster created from this
# image will have this SSH key as an authorized user.
# It can be overridden in each cluster's config file.
IMAGE_ROOT_SSH_PUBLIC_KEY=$HOME/.ssh/clusterroot.pub
IMAGE_ROOT_SSH_PRIVATE_KEY=$HOME/.ssh/clusterroot

# If this is "yes" (highly recommended), password based ssh authentication is disabled and key
# based authentication is the only option for all
# nodes created from this image.
#
# If this is "no", password based ssh authentication is enabled (even if
# it was disabled by default in the distribution), and both password and key
# based authentication are available on all nodes created from this image.
#
# This modifies the value of "PasswordAuthentication" in /etc/ssh/sshd_config.
IMAGE_DISABLE_SSH_PASSWORD_AUTHENTICATION=yes

# **** REQUIRED *****
#
# A username for administrative purposes. This username can be used by
# all sysadmins / devops / developers to ssh into any node created from
# this image.
# This should not be 'root'.
IMAGE_ADMIN_USER=clusteradmin

# **** REQUIRED *****
#
# Password for IMAGE_ADMIN_USER. 
# This should not be empty. If it is, it's considered a validation error
# and image creation will not proceed.
#
# Some special characters may require escape prefixing and the password to be enclosed in
# single or double quotes.
# Some examples:
# - for password with spaces, enclose in double quotes 
#		IMAGE_ADMIN_PASSWORD="a PassworD with spaces"
#
# - for password with double quotes, enclose in double quotes and prefix every double quote in the password with a backslash \ : 
#		IMAGE_ADMIN_PASSWORD="pswd_WITH_\"dbl\"_quotes"
#
# - for password with $, enclose in double quotes and prefix every $ in the password with a backslash \ : 
#		IMAGE_ADMIN_PASSWORD="pswd_with_\$a_"
IMAGE_ADMIN_PASSWORD=""

# **** REQUIRED *****
#
# A file containing public keys of all users who are authorized to 
# ssh into nodes as IMAGE_ADMIN_USER.
# This file can contain multiple public keys, just like a "authorized_keys" file.
# All these keys will be appended to the image's "authorized_keys".
IMAGE_ADMIN_SSH_AUTHORIZED_KEYS=$HOME/.ssh/clusteradmin.pub

# Size of disk image in MB (max 24000). ~5GB is good enough for most
# distributions, and allows enough leftover storage quota in every plan
# to create additional disks if required.
IMAGE_DISK_SIZE=5000

# Upgrades the OS before installing any software.
# Set to yes for production, no for simulator (because of complications with grub install)
UPGRADE_OS=yes
